This is the source code of the traditional Hello World program.

{hello.play}

`println` is a function that prints text to the
console.

A binary can be generated using the Kraken compiler: `kraken`.

```
$ kraken hello.krak
```

`kraken` will produce a `hello` binary that can be executed.

```
$ ./hello
Hello World!
```
