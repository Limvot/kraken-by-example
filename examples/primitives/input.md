Kraken provides access to a wide variety of `primitives`. A sample includes:

* integers: `int`
* floating point: `float`, `double`
* `char`
* `bool` either `true` or `false`

Variables can always be *type annotated*. Numbers may additionally be
annotated via a *suffix* or *by default*. Integers default to `int` and
floats to `double`.
