# Kraken by Example

[Kraken][kraken] is a work-in-progress systems programming language designed to be uncommonly flexible.

Kraken by Example is a set of examples intended to demonstrate how to program in Kraken.
You can also [check out the source code
for this site][home].

To make this site, I forked the wonderful rust-by-example website.
I owe a deep debt of gratitude to the fantastic Rust people for making and opensourcing cool
web tools to show off a programming language, as web programming is definity not my area.
